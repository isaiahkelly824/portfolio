        <p id="Me2"> Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, grew up in the inner city most of my life but still pulled through to be as great as I can be.</p>
        <p id="sports"> Growing up I played a lot of sports so it basically forced me to do well in school or else I couldn't play. From football, to a little bit of baseball, and basketball but I continued to persue basketball above all. </p>
